Just Another Linux and Open Source Enthusiast
--------------------------------

Nothing more, especially nothing professional. I just love anything open source. 

Interested in open source technologies, mainly Linux system administration and automation, WordPress administration and optimization.

* Been using Linux since the times when Windows booted in 30 seconds and Linux did in 3 minutes in one of my historic PCs. I think this must be a sign that I really love Linux. Strangely enough, the only thing I love about Windows is its classic theme. I tried everything to make my Linux desktop look like that with no success but these are the things of the past.
* Also interested in BASH, definitely not a guru, but I love to automate anything I can. You should really see how my laptop and then me panic together when the external command I passed to the __fd__ command goes crazy just because it found every bit in __$HOME__ recursively.
* Sometimes a server-side guy who prefers PHP over anything JavaScript. Believe me, the term __'Modern Tooling'__ scares me a lot.
* I no longer ask questions like _'Why is WordPress slow?'_ where the underlying machine is a single core VPS.
* Most of the times, I find myself hitting `jj` inside any text input. Once you learn how to exit VIM, there is no turning back.

### Skills (If you care at all)

Left to right, they are ordered from what I enjoy the most to what I disgust the most. Yes React, I'm talking to you. [Why? It's just that I simply cannot unlearn what I have learned, Master Yoda because you do not guarantee that what you teach will not be deprecated sooner or later.](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)
